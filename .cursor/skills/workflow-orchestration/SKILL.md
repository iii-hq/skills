  Reference implementation for durable multi-step workflow pipelines in iii. Use
  when building order fulfillment, data pipelines, or any sequential process
  requiring retries, backoff, step tracking, scheduled cleanup, or DLQ handling.

# Workflow Orchestration & Durable Execution

Comparable to: Temporal, Airflow, Inngest

## Key Concepts

- Each pipeline step is a registered function chained via **named queues** with config-driven retries
- Step progress is tracked in **shared state** and broadcast via **streams**
- A **cron trigger** handles scheduled maintenance (e.g. stale order cleanup)
- Queue behavior (retries, backoff, concurrency, FIFO) is defined per queue in `iii-config.yaml`

## Architecture

```
HTTP (create order)
  → Enqueue(order-validate) → validate
    → Enqueue(order-payment) → charge-payment
      → Enqueue(order-ship) → ship
        → publish(order.fulfilled)

Cron (hourly) → cleanup-stale

Queue configs (iii-config.yaml):
  order-validate:  max_retries: 2
  order-payment:   max_retries: 5, type: fifo, concurrency: 2
  order-ship:      max_retries: 3
```

## iii Primitives Used

| Primitive | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `registerWorker` | Initialize the worker and connect to iii |
| `registerFunction` | Define each pipeline step |
| `trigger({ ..., action: TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue }) })` | Durable step chaining via named queues |
| `trigger({ function_id: 'state::...', payload })` | Track step progress |
| `trigger({ ..., action: TriggerAction.Void() })` | Fire-and-forget stream events and publish |
| `registerTrigger({ type: 'cron' })` | Scheduled maintenance |
| `registerTrigger({ type: 'http' })` | Entry point |

## Reference Implementation

See [reference.js](reference.js) for the full working example — an order fulfillment pipeline
with validate → charge → ship steps, retry configuration, stream-based progress tracking,
and hourly stale-order cleanup.

## Minimum Patterns

Any code using this pattern must include at minimum:

- `registerWorker(url, { workerName })` — worker initialization
- `trigger({ function_id, payload, action: TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue }) })` — durable step chaining via named queues
- `trigger({ function_id: 'state::update', payload: { scope, key, ops } })` — step progress tracking
- Named queues with a comment referencing `iii-config.yaml` for retry/concurrency settings
- `const { logger } = getContext()` — structured logging per step
- Each step as its own `registerFunction` with a single responsibility
- `trigger({ function_id: 'publish', payload, action: TriggerAction.Void() })` — completion broadcast

## Adapting This Pattern

- Each step should do one thing and enqueue the next function on success
- Define separate named queues in `iii-config.yaml` when steps need different retry/concurrency settings
- The `trackStep` helper pattern (state update + stream event) is reusable for any pipeline
- Failed jobs exhaust retries and move to a DLQ — see the [dead-letter-queues HOWTO](https://iii.dev/docs/how-to/dead-letter-queues)
- Cron expressions use 7-position numeric format: `0 0 * * * * *` (every hour)
