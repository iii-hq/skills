# Python SDK

The async Python SDK for connecting workers to the iii engine.

## Documentation

Full API reference: <https://iii.dev/docs/api-reference/sdk-python>

## Install

`pip install iii-sdk`

## Key Exports

| Export                                        | Purpose                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `register_worker(address, options?)`          | Connect to the engine, returns the client       |
| `InitOptions(worker_name, otel?)`             | Connection configuration                        |
| `register_function(id, handler)`              | Register an async function handler              |
| `register_trigger(type, function_id, config)` | Bind a trigger to a function                    |
| `trigger(function_id, payload)`               | Invoke a function (async)                       |
| `trigger_void(function_id, payload)`          | Fire-and-forget invocation                      |
| `get_context()`                               | Access logger and trace context inside handlers |
| `ApiRequest` / `ApiResponse`                  | HTTP request/response types (pydantic)          |
| `IStream`                                     | Interface for custom stream implementations     |
| `on_functions_available(callback)`            | Listen for function discovery                   |
| `on_connection_state_change(callback)`        | Monitor connection state                        |

## Key Notes

- `register_worker()` returns a synchronous client; handlers are async
- `ApiResponse` uses camelCase `statusCode` (pydantic alias), not `status_code`
- End workers with `while True: await asyncio.sleep(60)` to keep the event loop alive
- Use `asyncio.to_thread()` for CPU-heavy sync work inside handlers

## Pattern Boundaries

- For usage patterns and working examples, see `functions-and-triggers`
- For Node.js SDK, see `node-sdk`
- For Rust SDK, see `rust-sdk`

## When to Use

- Use this skill when the task is primarily about `python-sdk` in the iii engine.
- Triggers when the request directly asks for this pattern or an equivalent implementation.

## Boundaries

- Never use this skill as a generic fallback for unrelated tasks.
- You must not apply this skill when a more specific iii skill is a better fit.
- Always verify environment and safety constraints before applying examples from this skill.
